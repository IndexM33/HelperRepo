-------Useful commands------------------------
git status - checks the status of the branch

git add . - stages all files the branch ready for commit

git add <filename> same as above. for indevidual files.

git commit -m "commit message" this is how we tell git to track our branch files. 


git log - shows commit logs

git checkout <branchname> moves from one branch to another. 

git pull origin - pulls most recent changes from remote (github)

git merge <branchname> will merge a branch into your current branch. 

git branch - will print current branches.

git branch -d <branchname> will delete a branch . 

git push origin <branchname> will push to remote (github) then you can greate a pull request on github and merge into main. 

git pull origin will then pull those changes into your local machine. 

branches should not really be reused. delete them after . 

git reset --hard <commit code from log>
